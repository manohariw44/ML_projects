## Instructions 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your  \texttt{R} code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

**NOTE**: YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE `install.packages` IN YOUR CODE; OTHERWISE, THE `Knit` OPTION WILL GIVE AN ERROR. COMMENT OUT ALL PACKAGE INSTALLATIONS.

Submit **both**  the `rmd` and generated `output` files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction. PDF or HTML is preferred. 

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3,5\ldots,29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```


### Q1
A bottle filling machine is set to fill bottles with soft drink to a volume of 500 ml. The
actual volume is known to follow a normal distribution. The manufacturer believes the
machine is under-filling bottles. A sample of 20 bottles is taken and the volume of liquid
inside is measured.
The volumes were: 484.11, 459.49, 471.38, 512.01, 494.48, 528.63, 493.64, 485.03, 473.88,
501.59, 502.85, 538.08, 465.68, 495.03, 475.32, 529.41, 518.13, 464.32, 449.08, 489.27
(a) Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.
(b) Use a one-sample t-test to determine whether the bottles are being consistently
under filled using a significance level of 0.01

#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
bottles <- c(484.11, 459.49, 471.38, 512.01, 494.48, 528.63,
493.64, 485.03, 473.88, 501.59, 502.85, 538.08, 465.68, 495.03,
475.32, 529.41, 518.13, 464.32, 449.08, 489.27)
mean(bottles)
sd(bottles)


```

### Q1b (8 points)
Create a new vector, `x_square`, with the square of elements at indices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 20, 23, 24, and 29 from the variable `x`. Hint: Use indexing rather than a `for` loop. Calculate the mean and median of the FIRST five values from `x_square`.
